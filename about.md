Machine Learning at Berkeley (ML@B) is a student-run organization based at the University of California, Berkeley, and is dedicated to building and fostering a vibrant machine learning community on the UC Berkeley campus. We aim to do so by providing resources, both educational and computational, to undergraduate and graduate students interested in exploring machine learning, and providing opportunities for them to get hands-on experience with real world problems in both academic research and industry settings. By growing a strong machine learning community at UC Berkeley, we hope to benefit, educate, and inspire the students at the university as well as aiding the machine learning community at large.
